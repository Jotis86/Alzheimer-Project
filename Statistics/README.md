# Summary of Advanced Statistical Analysis 📊

## Overview 🌟
This analysis provides insights into the relationships between various variables in the dataset and the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. We used several statistical measures, including skewness, kurtosis, and correlation coefficients (Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall), to understand the distribution and relationships of the data.

## Skewness 📈
Skewness measures the asymmetry of the distribution of values in a dataset. Key observations include:
- **CardiovascularDisease, Diabetes, HeadInjury, Hypertension, BehavioralProblems**: Highly right-skewed ➡️, indicating a long right tail.
- **MemoryComplaints, Confusion, Disorientation, PersonalityChanges, DifficultyCompletingTasks**: Moderately right-skewed ➡️.

## Kurtosis 📉
Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of the distribution of values. Key observations include:
- **CardiovascularDisease, Diabetes, HeadInjury, Hypertension, BehavioralProblems**: Positive kurtosis 📈, indicating heavier tails and more extreme values.
- **Most other variables**: Negative kurtosis 📉, indicating lighter tails than a normal distribution.

## Pearson Correlation Coefficients 🔗
Pearson correlation measures the linear relationship between variables. Key observations include:
- **Diagnosis and MemoryComplaints**: 0.306742 (Moderate positive correlation) ➕
- **Diagnosis and FunctionalAssessment**: -0.364898 (Moderate negative correlation) ➖
- **Diagnosis and ADL**: -0.332346 (Moderate negative correlation) ➖
- **Diagnosis and BehavioralProblems**: 0.224350 (Moderate positive correlation) ➕
- **Diagnosis and MMSE**: -0.237126 (Moderate negative correlation) ➖

## Spearman Correlation Coefficients 🔗
Spearman correlation measures the monotonic relationship between variables. Key observations include:
- **Diagnosis and MemoryComplaints**: 0.306742 (Moderate positive correlation) ➕
- **Diagnosis and FunctionalAssessment**: -0.366687 (Moderate negative correlation) ➖
- **Diagnosis and ADL**: -0.330450 (Moderate negative correlation) ➖
- **Diagnosis and BehavioralProblems**: 0.224350 (Moderate positive correlation) ➕
- **Diagnosis and MMSE**: -0.236271 (Moderate negative correlation) ➖

## Kendall Correlation Coefficients 🔗
Kendall correlation measures the ordinal association between variables. Key observations include:
- **Diagnosis and MemoryComplaints**: 0.306742 (Moderate positive correlation) ➕
- **Diagnosis and FunctionalAssessment**: -0.299469 (Moderate negative correlation) ➖
- **Diagnosis and ADL**: -0.269874 (Moderate negative correlation) ➖
- **Diagnosis and BehavioralProblems**: 0.224350 (Moderate positive correlation) ➕
- **Diagnosis and MMSE**: -0.192959 (Moderate negative correlation) ➖

## Key Insights 💡
- **MemoryComplaints**: Patients with more memory complaints tend to have a positive diagnosis of Alzheimer's. This suggests that memory complaints are a good indicator of the diagnosis. 🧠
- **FunctionalAssessment and ADL**: Both variables are negatively correlated with the diagnosis of Alzheimer's, indicating that lower functional assessment scores and reduced ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) are associated with a positive diagnosis. 🏥
- **BehavioralProblems**: Behavioral problems are moderately correlated with the diagnosis of Alzheimer's, suggesting that these issues are common in patients with Alzheimer's. 🧩
- **MMSE**: Lower MMSE scores are associated with a positive diagnosis of Alzheimer's, reinforcing the use of MMSE as an assessment tool for Alzheimer's. 📉

These statistical analyses provide valuable insights into the relationships between the variables in the dataset and the diagnosis of Alzheimer's, which can aid in the development of predictive models and the identification of key factors associated with the disease. 🔍
