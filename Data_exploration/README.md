# Data Exploration and Cleaning 🧹✨

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebook and documentation related to the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data cleaning process. The main steps involved in this process are:

## Steps Involved 🚀

### 1. Checking for Missing Values and Duplicates 🔍❓
- **Missing Values**: Identified and handled missing values in the dataset.
    - 🧮 Used methods such as mean/median imputation, or removal of rows/columns with excessive missing values.
- **Duplicates**: Checked for and removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
    - 🔄 Used techniques to identify and remove exact and near-duplicate entries.

### 2. Handling Outliers 📊⚠️
- **Outliers Detection**: Used statistical methods to detect outliers in the dataset.
    - 📉 Applied techniques such as Z-score, IQR (Interquartile Range), and visual methods like box plots.
- **Outliers Treatment**: Applied appropriate techniques to handle outliers, such as capping or removing them.
    - ✂️ Decided on a case-by-case basis whether to cap, transform, or remove outliers.

### 3. Converting Numerical Variables to Ranges 🔢📈
- **Binning**: Converted continuous numerical variables into categorical ranges for better analysis and modeling.
    - 📊 Used methods such as equal-width binning, equal-frequency binning, and custom binning based on domain knowledge.

## Files Included 📂

- **data_cleaning.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing all the steps for data cleaning and exploration.

## How to Use 🛠️

1. **Open `data_cleaning.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook contains all the steps for data cleaning and exploration.
2. **Run the Notebook**: Execute each cell in the notebook to perform the data cleaning steps.
3. **Review the Results**: The notebook includes visualizations and summaries of each step to help you understand the impact of the cleaning process.

## Summary 📝

The data exploration and cleaning process is crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of the dataset. By handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers, and by converting numerical variables to ranges, we prepare the data for subsequent analysis and modeling.

### Key Steps in the Notebook 📋

1. **Loading the Data**: 📥 Import the dataset and display the initial structure.
2. **Missing Values**: 🧩 Identify and handle missing values using various imputation techniques.
3. **Duplicates**: 🔍 Detect and remove duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
4. **Outliers**: 📊 Identify and treat outliers using statistical methods and visualizations.
5. **Binning and Normalization**: 📈 Convert numerical variables into categorical ranges and normalize the data for better analysis.

By following the steps outlined in the notebook, you can ensure that the dataset is clean, well-structured, and ready for further analysis and modeling.
