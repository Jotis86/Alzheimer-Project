# Alzheimer Project

## Objectives
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the probability of Alzheimer's in patients using clinical and imaging data. Additionally, we aim to create an interactive application to visualize the results and facilitate medical decision-making.

## Functionality
- Prediction of Alzheimer's probability using machine learning models.
- Interactive visualization of results through a web application.
- Analysis of clinical and imaging data to identify relevant patterns.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models.
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning models.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Streamlit**: Web application development.
- **PowerBI**: Advanced data visualization.
- **Trello**: Project management.

## Development Process
1. **Data Collection**: Obtaining clinical and imaging data from patients.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns and relationships in the data.
4. **Model Development**: Training and evaluating machine learning models.
5. **Application Deployment**: Creating an interactive web application with Streamlit.
6. **Data Visualization**: Using PowerBI for advanced visualizations.
