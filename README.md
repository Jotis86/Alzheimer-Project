## Objectives 🎯

The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive solution for the early detection and management of Alzheimer's disease. This includes:

1. **Machine Learning Model**: Predict the probability of Alzheimer's in patients using clinical data.
2. **Deep Learning Model**: Detect the presence of Alzheimer's disease in MRI brain scan images.
3. **Interactive Application**: Create an interactive Streamlit application to visualize the results and facilitate medical decision-making.
4. **Chat Bot Assistant**: Integrate a chat bot to assist users with questions related to Alzheimer's disease.
5. **Alexa Skill**: Develop an Alexa skill to assist both users and caregivers in their daily routines.

By combining these components, we aim to provide a robust tool for the early detection and management of Alzheimer's disease, ultimately improving patient outcomes and supporting caregivers.

## Python Visualizations 📈
We created various visualizations using Python to explore and present the data. These visualizations helped us understand the data better and communicate our findings effectively. You can view the visualizations [here](https://github.com/Jotis86/Alzheimer-Project/tree/main/Data_visualization).


## Statistical Analysis 📊
We conducted extensive statistical analysis to identify significant patterns and relationships in the data. This analysis provided valuable insights that informed our model development and decision-making processes. The detailed analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/Jotis86/Alzheimer-Project/tree/main/Statistics).

## 📊 PowerBI

## Machine Learning Models 🤖

We developed machine learning models to predict the probability of Alzheimer's disease based on clinical data. These models were trained and evaluated using Scikit-learn, and their performance was optimized through hyperparameter tuning. Detailed information and the code for these models can be accessed in our [Machine Learning section](https://github.com/Jotis86/Alzheimer-Project/tree/main/Machine_learning).

## Deep Learning Models 🧠

We developed deep learning models to detect the presence of Alzheimer's disease in MRI brain scan images. These models were built and trained using TensorFlow, and they aim to classify MRI images into different categories of dementia.
