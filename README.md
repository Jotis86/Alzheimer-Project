## Objectives 🎯

The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive solution for the early detection and management of Alzheimer's disease. This includes:

1. **Machine Learning Model**: Predict the probability of Alzheimer's in patients using clinical data.
2. **Deep Learning Model**: Detect the presence of Alzheimer's disease in MRI brain scan images.
3. **Interactive Application**: Create an interactive Streamlit application to visualize the results and facilitate medical decision-making.
4. **Chat Bot Assistant**: Integrate a chat bot to assist users with questions related to Alzheimer's disease.
5. **Alexa Skill**: Develop an Alexa skill to assist both users and caregivers in their daily routines.

By combining these components, we aim to provide a robust tool for the early detection and management of Alzheimer's disease, ultimately improving patient outcomes and supporting caregivers.
