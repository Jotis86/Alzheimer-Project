# 🧠 Alzheimer Detection from MRI Scans - Deep Learning Section

Welcome to the deep learning section of the Alzheimer Detection project! This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the process involved in creating and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect Alzheimer's disease from MRI brain scan images. Let's dive into the details! 🌊

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of MRI brain scan images stored in Parquet files. The data is divided into training and test sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

### Data Preparation 🛠️

1. **Loading Data** 📥: The data is loaded from Parquet files using pandas. This involves reading the files and storing the data in DataFrame objects for easy manipulation.
2. **Image Conversion** 🖼️: The images are stored as bytes and need to be converted to a format suitable for training. This involves converting the byte data into image arrays.
3. **Preprocessing** 🔄: The images are resized to a consistent size, normalized to have pixel values between 0 and 1, and converted to the appropriate number of channels (RGB).

## 🧑‍💻 Model Architecture

The model used in this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN). The architecture of the CNN includes the following layers:

- **Convolutional Layers** 🧩: These layers apply convolution operations to the input images, extracting important features. ReLU activation functions are used to introduce non-linearity.
- **MaxPooling Layers** 🏊: These layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, retaining the most important information.
- **Flatten Layer** 📏: This layer flattens the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector, preparing them for the fully connected layers.
- **Dense Layers** 🧠: These layers are fully connected layers that perform the final classification. ReLU activation functions are used in the hidden layers, and a softmax activation function is used in the output layer to produce class probabilities.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training the Model

The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss. The training process involves the following steps:

1. **Splitting the Data** ✂️: The data is split into training and validation sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the validation set is used to monitor the model's performance during training.
2. **Training** 🏃: The model is trained for a specified number of epochs. During each epoch, the model's weights are updated to minimize the loss function.
3. **Monitoring** 👀: The training and validation accuracy and loss are monitored to ensure that the model is learning effectively and not overfitting.

## 📊 Model Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated on the test set to determine its performance. The evaluation metrics include accuracy and the probabilities for each class. This helps in understanding how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

## 🖼️ Sample Images

To give you a better understanding of the dataset, here are some sample images from the training set:

- **Non Demented**: Images of brains without signs of dementia.
- **Very Mild Demented**: Images of brains with very mild signs of dementia.
- **Mild Demented**: Images of brains with mild signs of dementia.
- **Moderate Demented**: Images of brains with moderate signs of dementia.

## 🧪 Making Predictions

The trained model can be used to make predictions on new MRI brain scan images. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Loading the Trained Model** 📂: The trained model is loaded from the saved file.
2. **Preprocessing the New Image** 🔄: The new image is preprocessed in the same way as the training images (resizing, normalization, and channel conversion).
3. **Making the Prediction** 🔮: The preprocessed image is passed through the model to obtain the predicted class and the probabilities for each class.
4. **Displaying the Results** 📊: The predicted class and probabilities are displayed to the user.

## 📈 Results

The results of the model are displayed in a user-friendly manner, showing the predicted class and the probabilities for each class. This helps in understanding the model's confidence in its predictions.

## 📝 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of deep learning in medical imaging. By building a CNN, we can classify MRI brain scans and potentially aid in the early detection of Alzheimer's disease. Remember, this application is for educational purposes only and should not be used for real medical diagnoses.

## 🚀 Future Work

There are several ways to improve this project:
- **Experimenting with Different Model Architectures** 🏗️: Trying different CNN architectures to improve performance.
- **Using Data Augmentation** 📈: Increasing the dataset size by applying transformations to the existing images.
- **Fine-Tuning the Model** 🔧: Fine-tuning the model with more data to improve its accuracy and generalization.
